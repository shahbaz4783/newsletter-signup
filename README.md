Welcome to the **Introduction to SubscribeHub API** project! This lab will guide you through the foundational concepts and goals of the SubscribeHub API project. Before you begin, make sure to review the project prerequisites and understand the key concepts surrounding API development.

## Project Overview
SubscribeHub API is a powerful tool designed for simplified email and name collection, suitable for seamless integration into various web applications. This project focuses on building a robust API server using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose for asynchronous programming.

## Project Pre-requisites
Before diving into this project, it's essential to have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

* Node.js and JavaScript proficiency.
* Basic knowledge of asynchronous programming.
* Understanding of RESTful API design principles.
* Familiarity with MongoDB and Mongoose for database interactions.

We recommend taking the relevant courses on codedamn to ensure you're well-prepared for the challenges ahead.


## Key Concepts
*  **Asynchronous Programming:** Learn how to handle asynchronous operations using modern JavaScript features.
*  **RESTful API Design:** Understand the principles of designing APIs that follow RESTful conventions.
*  **Data Validation:** Explore techniques for validating user input and ensuring data integrity.
*  **Secure Data Handling:** Implement best practices for secure storage and retrieval of user information.
*  **MongoDB with Mongoose:** Integrate MongoDB as the database using Mongoose for smooth data interactions.

## Conclusion
By the end of this project, you will have a solid foundation in building a functional API for collecting email and name data, seamlessly connected to a MongoDB database.
